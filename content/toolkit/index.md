# SAFETAG Toolkit Prototype

Welcome to the safetag auditor toolkit, a prototype which aims to:
 - make it easier to navigate the SAFETAG Guide,
 - make it easier to contribute updated and new content to SAFETAG,
 - experiment with and discuss tools that can help streamline SAFETAG auditor's activities.

Let us know what you think via a [github issue](https://github.com/contentascode/safetag/issues) or [answer this survey](https://www.surveymonkey.de/r/G5Q5BF6 ) to help us put together a roadmap based on your needs.
