## Summary

This component allows the auditor to gauge staff awareness of social engineering risks. The staff take part in activities to explore what phishing look like based on sample "phishing campaign" style emails sent by the auditor as examples.  The auditor and staff will discuss the consequences of having their devices compromised.



## Considerations

  * Do not use “live” malware in this component. It is tempting to conduct an audit that more closely resembles a penetration test than a vulnerability assessment to expose the dangers of social engineering attacks. Distributing live malware and requires a much higher level of skill and comprehensive understanding of the deployed exploits in order to avoid possible service disruption.
