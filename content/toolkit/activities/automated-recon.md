# Automated Reconnaisance

## Summary

This component allows the auditor to quickly identify publicly available resources (such as websites, extranets, email servers, but also social media information) connected to the organization and remotely gather information about those resources.



## Considerations

  * Use VPNs to do automated searching. The automated process can be misconstrued by various services as malicious and cause your local network to get blocked, filtered, or surveilled. Tor is often blocked by the tools you will be using.
