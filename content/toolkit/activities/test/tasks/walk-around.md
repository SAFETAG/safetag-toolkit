### Walk around

As part of your first day, have your point of contact walk you around the office - this is primarily a chance to understand the office layout and meet the rest of the staff, but take mental note of the devices in use and laying out on desks as you walk around the office.  Note as well the location and access to components such as servers and networking components.

  * Device usage and storage,
  * Sensitive information or external storage drives lying on desks,
  * Accounts/passwords written on post-its, white-boards, etc.,
  * Unattended, logged in computers,
  * Unlocked cabinets, computer rooms, or wiring closets.

Taking actual notes may make the staff feel that you are judging them, so refrain from this if possible, especially if this is your first interaction.
