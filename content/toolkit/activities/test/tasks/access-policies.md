### Discuss access policies

Working with your POC and other relevant staff (administrative/operational staff, IT staff), enumerate list of everyone who has independent access to the office space, and routine after-hours access (i.e. who is able to unlock the space).  This may include cleaning or other service personnel.  Shared office spaces present unique challenges, and access policies and procedures for the building housing the office may also become relevant.
