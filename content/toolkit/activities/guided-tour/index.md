# Guided tour

## Summary

The physical assessment methodology is focused on how to mitigate against threats that occur because of the arrangement of digital assets in the physical world.

The assessment uses a walkthrough and interview methodology to answer the following questions:

  * How are daily devices used and stored?
  * Where are they when employees go home?
  * Are there active network jacks that are unused, are they in public spaces, are they in places where people would not notice if there was somthing plugged into them?
  * How are backups managed? Where are they stored?
  * Where are the servers and network components that host and manage the organizations assets?
  * Who has independent access to the office space?

## Approach

* Have your point of contact walk you around the office (often as part of introductions on the first day) - mentally note physical security concerns.
* Discuss access policies

## Materials Needed

* A notepad may be useful
