# Operational Security Survey

## Summary

This activity helps the auditor assess the organization's current operational security policies and practices through in-person or remote surveys and/or interviews. By also requesting to review and official policies as well as conducting multiple iterations of this with different staff members, some basic verification of the practices and awareness/understanding of existing policies can be achieved


## Materials Needed

* (optional) Survey system with appropriate security precautions and access controls
* Note-taking device that can be secured.
* For remote support, a secure videochat system (such as Signal) which works with the available bandwidth.

## Considerations

* Any physical notes taken on physical security should be destroyed. Digital notes should be kept in line with overall SAFETAG standards.
* Consider the threat context if an online survey tool is used to collect information and manage data access and storage responsibly.
* Any remote communication on physical security should be done over secured channels from a private space
* It should be noted that SAFETAG is focused only on the digital impacts of physical security.  This guide does not provide a full physical security assessment.

## Walkthrough

This activity should build on the preparation work of the auditor, as well as the capacity assessment and  context research work:

* **Capacity Assessment:** If the auditor has already completed the Capacity Assessment interview, many of the answers from its introductory "Open Up" questions (5-22) provide threat history, likelihood, and some basic policy information, and the questions grouped as "Threat Information," (58-68) go deeper into previous problems and responses.  If those were not asked, they can be included here as a follow-up interview/survey.
* **Context Research:** Ensure context research has revealed whether the organization would be targeted by adversaries due to their work (e.g. advocacy, engagement in or media coverage of socially sensitive topics, etc.). Threat identification and technical context research should  provide insight into likely technical capabilities of adversaries (are malware or other surillance tools used (https://sii.transparencytoolkit.org/) ? Physical surveillance/monitoring? Keyloggers?)

Once an initial interview or survey has taken place (as part of capacity assessment or dedicated to the above-mentioned questions), Send a follow-up request for any policies mentioned or referred to (travel policies, onboarding/offboarding policies for staff changes, personal device usage ("BYOD") policies, etc.). After reviewing those documents, request any additional policies those may refer to (general IT or security policies), and/or schedule a follow up interview or informal survey to dig deeper into remaining unanswered questions on the operatioal security situation of the organization as well as their adaptations to it.  In the (likely) case where there are no policies governing these topics, the auditor can ask their points of contact for these discussions what the general practices are and expand and verify this through additional activities.

In creating new questions, be careful to not "lead" on security in a way that would discourage honest and transparent responses.  For example, ask "Do you host community events and trainings?" instead of "Do you allow outside people into your office"?

Below are questions not already covered in the capacity assessment interview process, and after that selected questions from that process which are of particular use here.

**Office layout and access**

* Describe your office - is it on a floor of a building? An entire floor? (What level of the building?) How close are other buildings? Is it a shared, open office space or co-working space? (shared network? open access?)?

Has the organization dealt with robberies/theft, break-ins, or office raids?  If so, what happened, when, and how did you respond (or do you have a policy or contingency plan? When was that last reviewed/updated?)

Who has independent access to the office space, and routine after-hours access (i.e. who is able to unlock the space).  This may include security, cleaning or other building service personnel.

* What other wifi networks can you see? (See https://wigle.net/ )

**Programs and staff**

* Do you host events or trainings at the office?  Open "cybercafe" or community meeting space?
* Do you host 1:1 meetings with funders, partners,
* Do staff work from or meet at homes or cafes/restaurants?

**Selected questions from the Capacity Assessment Interview,  "Open Up" section:**

* What issues does the organization work on? Are these issues sensitive where you work?
* Where does your organization have activities?
* Does the organization have activities in more than one (city/provence/country/region)?
* What kind of funding does you organization receive?
* Does the organization have its own office space?
* Does the organization have a domain name or brand identity that is used for all online communications?
* Does the organization have a staff member responsible for working with digital or mobile technology?
* How regularly do staff members of the organization travel outside of your country
* Does the organization do any of the following activities when travelling internationally
  * Run programs
  * Participate in events
  * Run trainings
  * Receive trainings
  * Fundraising

**From "Threat Information"**

* To your knowledge, how often do the below incidents occur in the geographic areas or issue areas in which your organization is active? Could you please tell me if you think they happen never, sometimes or often
    * The government lawfully intercepts information communicated by civil society or private person
    * The government lawfully confiscates equipment because of the information it contains
    * Government, public officials, non-state actors, police or security forces use digital or mobile technology to identify and target individuals for arrest or violen

[^secure_reporting]:"When a pilot lands an airliner, their job isn’t over. They still have to navigate the myriad of taxiways and park at the gate safely. The same is true of you and your pen test reports, just because its finished doesn't mean you can switch off entirely. You still have to get the report out to the client, and you have to do so securely. Electronic distribution using public key cryptography is probably the best option, but not always possible. If symmetric encryption is to be used, a strong key should be used and must be transmitted out of band. Under no circumstances should a report be transmitted unencrypted. It all sounds like common sense, but all too often people fall down at the final hurdle." - [The Art of Writing Penetration Test Reports](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/writing-penetration-testing-reports/)

[^stares_and_snide_comments]:"I once performed a social engineering test, the results of which were less than ideal for the client.

During my introduction, I explained that my company did security testing and was responsible for the social engineering test a few weeks back. This was greeted with angry stares and snide comments about how I’d gotten them all into trouble.
