## Summary

The auditor conducts interviews with various staff members to gather information on the organizations risks and capacity.

Q&A sessions are unabashedly _white box_ aspects of a security assessment, and you will occasionally hear push-back along the lines of, "You wouldn't have found that thing if we hadn't told you about this other thing." Compelling _black box_ findings certainly do have an advantage when it comes to persuasiveness, but obtaining them can be quite time-consuming, so relying exclusively on vulnerabilities that you can identify without "help" is generally a mistake in this resource-constrained sector.



## Considerations

  * If the auditor or organization believes that there is a good chance of surveillance on the channel you are communicating over, do the rest of the interview on a secured channel or in person where possible, though some information-gathering is critical to do before planning the audit. Inability to do so contributes towards a no-go situation.
