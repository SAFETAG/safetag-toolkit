# SAFETAG Auditor Toolkit

Welcome to the safetag auditor toolkit which enables you to:
 - plan an audit by selecting and tayloring activities within the SAFETAG framework,
 - create a audit project folder to keep track of the plan,
 - gather information and take notes in a single location,
 - share relevant part of the plan to the audited organisation's stakeholders,
 - contribute back to the SAFETAG framework.

## Plan

<!--  This should open the faceted widget with an empty configuration. -->

[New Plan](planner template:"new")
: Start from an empty template and select the activities, tasks and relevant details to build your audit plan.

<!-- This should open the faceted widget with a preset configuration. -->

[Minimum Audit Template](planner template:"minimum-audit")
: Start from our minimum viable audit plan for a small organisation and modify it according to the needs of the audited organisations.

:[](audit-timeline-planning "collapsed")

<!-- This should transclude (maybe in a collapsible?) the existing `audit-timeline-planning` planning section of the guide, adapted to enable checking boxes as the plan is being developed. The planning guide should continue to be visible once the audit has been created to enable iterating. -->

## Browse

> Will be both a bottom expanded nav and a top dropdown nav.
